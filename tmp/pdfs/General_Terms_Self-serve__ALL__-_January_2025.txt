 2.  GETTING  YOU  SET  UP  WITH  A  GOCARDLESS  ACCOUNT  SO  YOU  CAN  START  USING  THE  SERVICES   Before  you  start  applying  for  a  GoCardless  Account,  is  there  anything  you  should  know  about  
eligibility
 
or
 
restrictions
 
on
 
having
 
a
 
GoCardless
 
Account
 
or
 
using
 
the
 
Services?
 2.1  Yes.   The  GoCardless  Account  and  the  Services  are  a  business  tool  and  so  only  businesses  (which  includes  sole  traders)  and  charities  located  in  the  jurisdictions  set  out  in  the  Product  Description  Document are  eligible  to  apply  for  a  GoCardless  Account  and  to  use  the  Services.   This  also  means  the  Services  can  only  
be
 
used
 
for
 
business
 
purposes
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
permitted
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
Services
 
for
 
any
 
personal,
 
family
 
or
 
household
 
purposes.
 
 2.3  You  must  not  use  the  Services  for  any  Restricted  Activities.   2.3  Not  all  Services  are  available  in  all  jurisdictions.   An  up  to  date  list  of  which  Services  are  available  and  where  they  are  available  can  be  found  in  the  Product  Description  Document.    How  do  you  set  up  a  GoCardless  Account?   2.4  If  you  want  to  use  the  Services,  you  must  apply  for  a  GoCardless  Account.   You  can  apply  for  a  GoCardless  
Account
 
through
 
the
 
GoCardless
 
Site.
 
  Does  GoCardless  need  to  undertake  any  identity  veriﬁcation  before  you  can  start  using  the  Services?  2.5  Yes.   Even  if  you  successfully  set  up  a  GoCardless  Account,  you  will  not  be  able  to  start  using  any  of  the  
Services
 
until
 
GoCardless
 
has
 
performed
 
Veriﬁcation
 
on
 
you.
  
You
 
acknowledge
 
and
 
agree
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
want
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
provide
 
Services
 
to
 
you,
 
you
 
must
 
provide
 
the
 
information
 
and
 
assistance
 
required
 
by
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
facilitate
 
Veriﬁcation.
   
 2.6  To  complete  Veriﬁcation,  you  must  provide  reasonable  assistance  and  information  to  GoCardless,  based  on  
the
 
information
 
GoCardless
 
requests
 
from
 
you,
 
which
 
may
 
include
 
information
 
and
 
documentation
 
about
 
your
 
business
 
activities,
 
directors,
 
beneﬁcial
 
owners
 
and
 
Nominated
 
Account.
  
You
 
may
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
verify
 
you
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
Nominated
 
Account
 
by
 
using
 
the
 
Veriﬁcation
 
Tool.
  
If
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
provide
 
the
 
information
 
requested
 
in
 
full,
 
or
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
verify
 
you
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
Nominated
 
Account,
 
you
 
will
 
not
 
satisfy
 
Veriﬁcation
 
and
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
Services.

===== PAGE 3 =====
2.7  Depending  on  the  Services  you  are  applying  for  under  the  Agreement,  GoCardless  may  elect  to  require  a  
lighter
 
level
 
of
 
Veriﬁcation
 
from
 
you
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
GoCardless
 
Account:
 
for
 
example
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
only
 
applying
 
to
 
use
 
a
 
Service
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
subject
 
to
 
anti-money
 
laundering
 
customer
 
due
 
diligence
 
requirements
 
under
 
Applicable
 
Law.
    
 2.8  GoCardless  will  give  you  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  to  complete  Veriﬁcation,  but  if  GoCardless  decides  
you
 
have
 
not
 
satisﬁed
 
Veriﬁcation,
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
not
 
provide
 
any
 
Services
 
to
 
you
 
and
 
will
 
cancel
 
your
 
GoCardless
 
Account
 
with
 
immediate
 
effect.
  
GoCardless
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
provide
 
you
 
with
 
speciﬁc
 
detail
 
regarding
 
any
 
failure
 
by
 
you
 
to
 
satisfy
 
Veriﬁcation.
 
GoCardless
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
provide
 
such
 
detail,
 
but
 
will
 
not
 
do
 
so
 
where
 
it
 
determines
 
in
 
its
 
sole
 
discretion
 
that
 
doing
 
so
 
would
 
cause
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
be
 
in
 
breach
 
of
 
Applicable
 
Law.
 2.9  If  you  apply  to  use  certain  Services  we  may  require  you  to  provide  us  with  additional  information  about  
your
 
business
 
prior
 
to
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
relevant
 
Service.
  
You
 
acknowledge
 
and
 
agree
 
that
 
if
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
provide
 
us
 
with
 
this
 
additional
 
information
 
upon
 
request
 
you
 
may
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
Service.

 3.6  Where  a  Service  needs  to  be  enabled  before  it  can  be  used,  the  Service  can  be  enabled  and/or  
activated
 
either:
 
(a)
 
via
 
your
 
GoCardless
 
Account,
 
where
 
that
 
functionality
 
is
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
Dashboard;
 
or
 
(b)
 
otherwise
 
by
 
GoCardless.
  
Where
 
you
 
use
 
the
 
Services
 
via
 
the
 
API,
 
you
 
may
 
need
 
to
 
update
 
your
 
API
 
before
 
enabling
 
any
 
Service.
 
 3.7  In  order  to  have  continuous  access  to  the  Dashboard,  you  will  need  to  set  up  MFA.   If  you  do  not  set  
up
 
MFA
 
as
 
required
 
by
 
GoCardless,
 
you
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
able
 
to

the
 
Dashboard.
  
Once
 
you
 
have
 
set
 
up
 
MFA,
 
you
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
MFA
 
each
 
time
 
you
 
log
 
in
 
to
 
the
 
Dashboard.

how
 
it
 
works
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
can

set
 
up,
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
on
 
the
 
Customer

If
 
you
 
are
 
upgrading
 
your
 
Pricing

any
 
additional

of
 
the

following
 
the

in
 
which
 
you
 
conﬁrm
 
your
 
upgrade.
  
If
 
you
 
are
 
downgrading
 
your
 
Pricing
 
Plan,
 
you
 
will
 
still
 
be
 
able
 
to

until
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the

the
 
Services

including
 
if
 
you
 
become
 
subject,
 
or
 
are
 
no
 
longer
 
subject,
 
to
 
regulatory
 
oversight;
 
or
 
(d)
 
a
 
Regulatory
 
Authority
 
has
 
notiﬁed
 
you
 
that
 
you
 
or
 
your
 
business
 
is
 
the
 
subject
 
of
 
investigative
 
action.
  
 3.31  You  must  tell  GoCardless  immediately  of  any  Insolvency  Event  and  include  GoCardless  as  a  creditor  
in
 
relation
 
to
 
any
 
insolvency
 
proceedings.
 3.32  If  you  undergo  a  change  of  Control,  you  must  use  reasonable  efforts  to  notify  GoCardless  before  that  
change
 
of
 
Control
 
and,
 
in
 
any
 
event,
 
you
 
must
 
notify
 
GoCardless
 
immediately
 
following
 
the
 
change
 
of
 
Control
 
and
 
provide
 
the
 
details
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
party
 
with
 
Control.
  
Following
 
a
 
change
 
of
 
Control:
 
(a)
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
run
 
anti-money
 
laundering
 
checks
 
on
 
you,
 
taking
 
into
 
account
 
the
 
new
 
party
 
with
 
Control,
 
for
 
which
 
you
 
agree
 
to
 
provide
 
all
 
information
 
reasonably
 
requested
 
by
 
GoCardless;
 
and
 
(b)
 
if,
 
following
 
the
 
change
 
of
 
Control,
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
able
 
to
 
meet
 
GoCardless’
 
anti-money
 
laundering
 
or
 
other
 
legal
 
or
 
regulatory
 
requirements,
 
GoCardless
 
may
 
immediately
 
terminate
 
this
 
Agreement.
 3.33  If  you  don’t  tell  GoCardless  about  any  change,  or  you  fail  to  provide  GoCardless  with  notice  within  
the
 
timescales
 
required
 
above,
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
be
 
entitled
 
to
 
take
 
any
 
action
 
it
 
deems
 
necessary,
 
which
 
may

include  suspending  your  GoCardless  Account  and/or  your  use  of  the  Services,  or  terminating  this  
Agreement,
 
both
 
with
 
immediate
 
effect.
 
 Does  GoCardless  ever  test  new  products  or  features  and,  if  so,  how  will  this  affect  you?   3.34  Yes.   GoCardless  is  constantly  innovating  to  try  and  improve  its  Services  and  in  order  to  make  improvements  
it
 
needs
 
to
 
test
 
its
 
innovations
 
and
 
upgrades.
  
You
 
acknowledge
 
and
 
agree
 
that:
 
(a)
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
contacted
 
directly
 
by
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
any
 
Early
 
Access
 
Programme,
 
the
 
corresponding
 
early
 
access
 
terms
 
and
 
conditions
 
found
 
on
 
the
 
GoCardless
 
Site
 
or
 
the
 
terms
 
and
 
conditions
 
provided
 
to
 
you
 
by
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
apply;
 
(b)
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
invited
 
by
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
use
 
any
 
Service
 
on
 
a
 
trial
 
basis,
 
and
 
you
 
use
 
that
 
Service
 
on
 
a
 
trial
 
basis,
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
bound
 
by
 
the
 
relevant
 
Service
 
Terms
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
that
 
use,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
any
 
other
 
terms
 
which
 
may
 
be
 
agreed
 
between
 
you
 
and
 
GoCardless
 
for
 
the
 
trial
 
use;
 
(c)
 
GoCardless
 
may,
 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time,
 
undertake
 
experiments
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
any
 
Service
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
test
 
the
 
effectiveness
 
of
 
new
 
products
 
or
 
features.
  
You
 
therefore
 
acknowledge
 
and
 
agree
 
that
 
GoCardless
 
may
 
perform
 
these
 
experiments
 
and
 
that
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
not
 
inform
 
you
 
if
 
it
 
does
 
perform
 
experiments.
 3.35  GoCardless  may  classify  certain  services,  including  a  release  or  feature,  as  ‘Beta’.   By  their  nature,  and  
because
 
they
 
are
 
still
 
being
 
developed,
 
Beta
 
Services
 
may
 
not
 
include
 
all
 
features
 
and
 
may
 
contain
 
bugs.
  
GoCardless
 
may
 
describe
 
limitations
 
that
 
exist
 
within
 
a
 
Beta
 
Service,
 
but
 
your
 
reliance
 
on
 
the
 
accuracy
 
or
 
completeness
 
of
 
these
 
descriptions
 
is
 
at
 
your
 
own
 
risk.
  
You
 
should
 
not
 
use
 
Beta
 
Services
 
in
 
a
 
production
 
environment
 
until
 
and
 
unless
 
you
 
understand
 
and
 
accept
 
the
 
limitations
 
and
 
ﬂaws
 
that
 
may
 
be
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
Beta
 
Services.
  
Unless
 
GoCardless
 
otherwise
 
agrees
 
in
 
writing,
 
your
 
use
 
of
 
Beta
 
Services
 
is
 
conﬁdential,
 
and
 
you
 
must
 
provide
 
timely
 
feedback
 
on
 
the
 
Beta
 
Services
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
requests.
  
GoCardless
 
may
 
suspend
 
or
 
terminate
 
your
 
access
 
to
 
any
 
Beta
 
Services
 
at
 
any
 
time.

GoCardless
 
Account
 
and
 
you
 
must
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
Authorised
 
Users
 
of
 
the
 
Account
 
Details
 
also
 
take
 
reasonable
 
steps
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
same.
  
You
 
must
 
ensure
 
the
 
requirements
 
around
 
MFA
 
are
 
fulﬁlled
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
have
 
continued
 
access
 
to
 
the

 4.2  The  reasonable  steps  referred  to  in  clause  4.1  above  include:  (a)  keeping  Account  Details  and  any  paperwork  
relating

and/or
 
disclosure;
 
(b)
 
not

the
 
same
 
location
 
together;
 
(c)
 
updating
 
passwords
 
for
 
the
 
GoCardless
 
Account
 
on
 
a
 
regular
 
basis
 
and
 
in
 
any
 
event
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
every
 
six
 
(6)
 
months;
 
(d)
 
ensuring
 
that
 
passwords
 
for
 
the
 
GoCardless
 
Account
 
are
 
sufﬁciently
 
strong,
 
by
 
using
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
words,
 
numbers,
 
symbols
 
and
 
upper
 
and
 
lower
 
case
 
letters
 
(providing
 
such
 
password
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
the
 
username);
 
(e)
 
taking
 
reasonable
 
care
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
third
 
parties
 
do
 
not
 
oversee
 
or
 
overhear
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
Account
 
Details;
 
(f)
 
immediately
 
terminating

Details
 
by
 
any
 
third
 
party
 
who
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
an
 
Authorised
 
User;
 
and
 
(g)
 
ensuring
 
Authorised
 
Users
 
who
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
Account
 
Details,
 
including
 
any
 
devices
 
or
 
other
 
methods
 
for
 
undertaking
 
MFA,
 
use
 
the
 
Account
 
Details
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
this
 
Agreement;
 
and
 
(h)
 
informing
 
GoCardless
 
without
 
undue
 
delay
 
on
 
becoming
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
loss,
 
theft,
 
misappropriation
 
or
 
unauthorised
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
Account
 
Details,
 
at
 
which
 
point
 
you
 
must
 
immediately
 
change
 
all
 
passwords
 
for
 
the
 
Account
 
Details.
  What  will  GoCardless  do  to  make  sure  your  GoCardless  Account  and  the  Services  are  secure?  4.3  GoCardless  will  take  adequate  steps  in  accordance  with  Good  Industry  Practice  and  as  required  by  
Applicable
 
Law
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
GoCardless
 
Account,
 
the
 
Services
 
and
 
the
 
API
 
are
 
secure
 
and
 
that
 
data
 
is
 
protected
 
against
 
loss
 
or
 
unauthorised
 
disclosure.
  What  happens  if  there  is  suspected  fraud  on  your  GoCardless  Account?  4.4  If  you  think  there  has  been  fraudulent  or  otherwise  unauthorised  use  of  your  GoCardless  Account  
and/or
 
the
 
Services,
 
you
 
must
 
notify
 
GoCardless.
  
You
 
must
 
notify
 
GoCardless
 
as
 
soon
 
as
 
reasonably
 
practicable
 
if
 
you
 
become
 
aware
 
of
 
any
 
fraudulent
 
or
 
other
 
illegal
 
activity
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
Customer,
 
any

Authorised  User  and/or  any  other  third  party  (including  money  laundering  or  the  ﬁnancing  of  any  terrorist  
activities)
 
by

GoCardless
 
at
 
help@gocardless.com,
 
provided
 
that
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
would
 
not
 
cause
 
you
 
to

in
 
breach
 
of
 
Applicable
 
Law.
 4.5  If  you  think  there  has  been  fraudulent  or  otherwise  unauthorised  or  unlawful  use  of  any  Service,  you  
should
 
also
 
check
 
the
 
relevant
 
Service
 
Terms
 
to
 
see
 
if
 
there
 
are
 
any
 
particular
 
steps
 
which
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
by
 
you
 
in
 
relation
 
to
 
that
 
Service.
 
 4.6  If  GoCardless  needs  to  contact  you  about  suspected  fraud  or  any  other  security  threat,  it  will  do  so  
in
 
the
 
manner
 
that
 
it
 
deems
 
to
 
be
 
most
 
secure
 
in
 
the
 
circumstances,
 
which
 
could
 
be
 
through
 
the
 
Dashboard
 
and
 
your
 
GoCardless
 
Account,
 
the
 
API
 
or
 
email.
 4.7  If  GoCardless  suspects  that  any  Transaction  or  attempted  Transaction  is  fraudulent,  is  in  violation  of  
this
 
Agreement,
 
Applicable
 
Law
 
or
 
the
 
Payment
 
Scheme
 
Rules,
 
or
 
is
 
likely
 
to
 
expose
 
either
 
GoCardless,
 
or
 
any
 
other
 
party
 
to
 
harm,
 
GoCardless
 
reserves
 
the
 
right
 
not
 
to
 
process
 
that
 
Transaction.
  
If
 
the
 
Transaction
 
has
 
already
 
been
 
processed,
 
GoCardless
 
may
 
reverse
 
it
 
if
 
possible
 
to
 
do
 
so,

advise
 
the
 
Customer
 
to
 
claim
 
the
 
funds
 
back
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
Chargeback
 
that
 
you
 
would
 
be

for.
 
  How  does  GoCardless  interact  with  Regulatory  Authorities  and  how  does  it  deal  with  Legal  Process  
Requests?
 4.8  As  a  regulated  ﬁnancial  services  business,  GoCardless  regularly  interacts  with  Regulatory  Authorities,  
including
 
law
 
enforcement
 
agencies,
 
and
 
may
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
provide
 
information
 
to
 
those
 
Regulatory
 
Authorities.
  
You
 
grant
 
GoCardless
 
permission
 
to
 
provide
 
any
 
Regulatory
 
Authority
 
with
 
information
 
about
 
you,
 
your
 
Transactions
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
information
 
GoCardless
 
holds,
 
if
 
GoCardless
 
suspects
 
your
 
GoCardless
 
Account
 
has
 
been
 
used
 
or
 
is
 
likely
 
to
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
manner
 
set
 
out
 
in
 
clause
 
4.7
 
above.
  
GoCardless
 
may
 
do
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
things
 
even
 
if
 
this
 
Agreement
 
has
 
ended.
 4.9  GoCardless  respects  your  privacy.   However,  GoCardless  reserves  the  right  to  respond  to  any  Legal  
Process
 
Request
 
it
 
believes
 
is
 
valid.

to
 
you
 
or
 
any
 
other
 
party,
 
whether
 
for
 
indirect
 
or
 
direct
 
Losses
 
or
 
otherwise,
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
GoCardless’
 
compliance
 
or
 
non-compliance
 
with
 
any
 
Legal
 
Process
 
Request.
 4.10  GoCardless  may  deliver  funds  relating  to  your  use  of  a  Service,  where  required  to  do  so  by  or  in  
connection
 
with
 
a
 
Legal
 
Process

Where

in
 
GoCardless’

 5.  FEES,  AUTHORISED  DEDUCTIONS  AND  INVOICING    What  do  you  have  to  pay  to  GoCardless  for  accessing  your  GoCardless  Account  and  using  the  
Services?
 5.1  In  consideration  for  GoCardless  providing  you  with  your  GoCardless  Account  and  the  Services,  you  must  
pay,
 
or
 
ensure
 
GoCardless
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
collect,
 
the
 
Fees
 
and
 
other
 
amounts
 
you
 
owe
 
under
 
the
 
Agreement
 
when
 
due.
  
The
 
details
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
Fees
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
pay
 
are
 
set
 
out
 
on
 
the
 
Legal
 
Pricing

  How  do  you  pay  the  Fees?  5.2  The  Fees  (other  than  Add-On  Feature  Fees  and  Direct  Settlement  Fees)  payable  by  you  to  
GoCardless
 
will
 
be
 
automatically
 
paid
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
when
 
they
 
become
 
due
 
and
 
payable.
  
These
 
Fees
 
will
 
be
 
paid
 
from
 
the
 
funds
 
received
 
by
 
GoCardless
 
from
 
a
 
Customer's
 
bank
 
in
 
satisfaction
 
of
 
a
 
Payment
 
Order.
  
This
 
payment
 
of
 
Fees
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
be
 
made
 
before
 
funds
 
due
 
to
 
you
 
are
 
paid
 
to
 
the
 
Nominated
 
Account.
  
The
 
point
 
in
 
time
 
when
 
the
 
Fees
 
become
 
due
 
and
 
payable
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
Service
 
and
 
the
 
Payment
 
Scheme
 
and
 
is
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
the
 
timelines
 
prescribed
 
by
 
this
 
Agreement
 
and
 
the
 
relevant
 
Payment
 
Scheme
 
Timings.
 5.3  If  you  have  activated  an  Add-On  Feature  which  incurs  an  associated  Add-On  Feature  Fee,  
GoCardless
 
will
 
issue
 
an
 
invoice
 
to
 
you
 
for
 
that
 
speciﬁc
 
Add-On
 
Feature
 
Fee.
 5.4  If  you  use  a  Service  to  which  Direct  Settlement  Fees  apply,  GoCardless  will  issue  an  invoice  to  you  
8

===== PAGE 9 =====
for  those  Direct  Settlement  Fees.   What  will  GoCardless  automatically  pay  to  itself?  5.5  Prior  to  paying  funds  due  to  you  to  the  Nominated  Account,  you  explicitly  acknowledge,  agree,  and  
authorise
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
make
 
certain
 
payments
 
to
 
itself
 
as
 
described
 
in
 
clauses
 
5.6
 
to
 
5.9
 
below.
  
 5.6  GoCardless  will  pay  to  itself  all  Fees  that  become  due  and  payable  to  GoCardless,  as  described  in  
clause
 
5.2
 
above,
 
and
 
which
 
are
 
not
 
invoiced
 
to
 
you.
 5.7  GoCardless  will  pay  to  itself  the  Authorised  Deductions  when  they  become  due  and  payable  to  
GoCardless.
  
The
 
point
 
in
 
time
 
when
 
the
 
Authorised
 
Deductions
 
become
 
due
 
and
 
payable
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
depends
 
on
 
the
 
Service
 
and
 
the
 
Payment
 
Scheme
 
and
 
is
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
the
 
timelines
 
prescribed
 
by
 
this
 
Agreement
 
and
 
the
 
relevant
 
Payment
 
Scheme
 
Timings.
 5.8  GoCardless  will  pay  to  itself  the  Fees  (including  Add-On  Feature  Fees  and  Direct  Settlement  Fees),  
immediately
 
and
 
continuously,
 
under
 
the
 
following
 
circumstances:
 
(a)
 
you
 
fail
 
to
 
pay
 
the
 
Fees
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
clause
 
5.2
 
above;
 
(b)
 
you
 
experience
 
an
 
Insolvency
 
Event
 
or
 
if
 
GoCardless
 
reasonably
 
suspects
 
that
 
such
 
an
 
event

 5.9  GoCardless  will  pay  to  itself  any  VAT  payable  on  the  Fees.   If  you  have  to  pay  Fees  which  are  not  paid  automatically,  or  you  have  an  excess  of  Authorised  
Deductions,
 
how
 
will
 
you
 
be
 
invoiced
 
for
 
these,
 
and
 
what
 
are
 
the
 
payment
 
terms?
 5.10  If  you  have  to  pay  Fees  which  are  not  paid  automatically  (in  accordance  with  clause  5.2  above),  
GoCardless
 
will
 
invoice

otherwise
 
speciﬁed,
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
an
 
electronic
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
invoice.
  
 5.11  If  the  amount  of  any  Authorised  Deductions  (including  if  this  Agreement  has  ended)  exceeds  the  
amount
 
of
 
any
 
sums
 
payable
 
by
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
you,
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
invoice
 
you
 
for
 
the
 
difference.
 5.12  You will  need  to  provide  GoCardless  with  a  nominated  billing  email  address  which  will  be  used  to  send  
invoices
 
to
 
you.
  
GoCardless
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
invoice
 
you
 
using
 
a
 
purchase
 
order
 
or
 
via
 
a
 
speciﬁc
 
online
 
portal.
 5.13  You  agree  to  pay  any  invoiced  Fees  and  any  other  amounts  referred  to  in  this  clause  5  to  GoCardless  
by
 
way
 
of
 
direct
 
debit
 
and
 
will
 
set
 
up
 
a
 
direct
 
debit
 
mandate
 
as
 
and
 
when
 
required
 
by
 
GoCardless.
  5.14  You  must  pay  any  invoice  issued  to  you  by  GoCardless  in  full  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  invoice  
date.
 
 
If
 
payment
 
of
 
any
 
invoice
 
is
 
overdue,
 
GoCardless
 
has
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
to
 
pay
 
interest
 
on
 
the
 
overdue
 
amount
 
from
 
the
 
date
 
payment
 
was
 
due
 
until
 
you
 
have
 
paid
 
the
 
overdue
 
amount
 
at
 
the
 
rate
 
of
 
the
 
Bank
 
of
 
England
 
base
 
rate
 
plus
 
4%.
  Do  you  have  to  pay  VAT?  5.15  Yes.  All  Fees  are  exclusive  of  any  VAT.   VAT  is  payable  on  Fees  (whether  payable  by  way  of  deduction  
or
 
otherwise)
 
on
 
delivery
 
of
 
a

From
 
the

any
 
amount
 
payable
 
under
 
or
 
pursuant
 
to
 
this
 
Agreement
 
(including
 
any
 Connected  Merchant  Agreement)  constitutes  the  consideration  for  a  supply  for  VAT  purposes  subject  to  or  chargeable  to  any  VAT  (whether  by  way  of  payment,  deduction  or  set  off  or  otherwise),  then  that  
amount/payment
 
shall
 
be
 
exclusive
 
of
 
any
 
such
 
VAT
 
so
 
that,
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
that
 
payment,
 
you
 
shall
 
pay
 
on
 
receipt
 
(by
 
you
 
or
 
by
 
the
 
relevant
 
service
 
recipient,
 
as
 
the
 
case
 
may
 
be)
 
of

(if
 
such

is
 
required
 
by
 
applicable

shall

equal
 
to
 
VAT
 
which
 
has
 
not
 
been

has
 
been

subsequently
 
becomes

payable
 
in
 
respect
 
of
 
any
 
previous
 
completed
 
or
 
paid
 
for
 
supplies

instructions
 
set

 5.17  When  applicable,  each  Party  will  make  any  necessary  VAT  invoicing  or  other  applicable  VAT  
adjustments
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
and
 
where
 
required
 
by
 
applicable

agreed
 
between
 
the

  Can  GoCardless  change  the  Fees?  5.18  Yes.   GoCardless  can  change  the  Fees  at  any  time.   If  GoCardless  is  going  to  change  the  Fees,  
GoCardless
 
will
 
give
 
you
 
at

two

do
 
not
 
notify
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
the
 
contrary
 
before
 
the
 
date
 
on
 
which
 
the
 
proposed
 
changes
 
will
 
enter
 
into
 
force,
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
deemed
 
to
 
have
 
accepted
 
the
 
revised
 
Fees.
  
You
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
right
 
to

  Are  there  other  provisions  you  should  be  aware  of  relating  to  the  Fees,  Authorised  Deductions  and

you

of
 
the
 
risk
 
presented
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
(including

or
 
other
 
risks);
 
(l)
 
while

is
 
conducting
 
Veriﬁcation

checks
 
on
 
you,

where
 
Veriﬁcation
 
cannot

(n)
 
GoCardless
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
by
 
Applicable
 
Law,
 
or
 
it
 
becomes
 
illegal
 
to
 
provide
 
the
 
GoCardless
 
Account
 
and/or
 
any
 
Service;
 
or
 
(o)
 
you
 
are

Sanctions
 
Regulations
 
and/or
 
collect
 
from
 
or
 
for
 
a
 
sanctioned
 
entity
 
or
 
territory.
  
 9.2  In  addition,  in  certain  circumstances,  it  may  be  necessary  for  GoCardless  to  withhold  performance  of  all  or  
part
 
of
 
any
 
Service,
 
on
 
a
 
temporary
 
or
 
permanent
 
basis,
 
for
 
reasons
 
including
 
where:
 
(a)
 
a
 
Force
 
Majeure
 
Event
 
occurs
 
affecting
 
GoCardless,
 
any
 
subcontractor
 
or
 
service
 
provider
 
of
 
GoCardless
 
and/or
 
the
 
Customer’s
 
bank;
 
(b)
 
any
 
subcontractor
 
or
 
service
 
provider
 
fails
 
to
 
provide
 
services
 
to
 
GoCardless
 
upon
 
which
 
GoCardless
 
relies
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
provide
 
the
 
Services
 
to
 
you;
 
and/or
 
(c)
 
GoCardless
 
reasonably
 
believes
 
it
 
is
 
necessary
 
to
 
do
 
so
 
to
 
protect
 
GoCardless
 
from
 
broad-based
 
market
 
failure.
  
In
 
any
 
such
 
cases,
 
GoCardless
 
will
 
have
 
no
 
liability
 
to
 
you
 
for
 
not
 
providing
 
any
 
Service.
 9.3  Where  you  are  in  breach  of  the  Agreement  and  the  breach  is  remediable  GoCardless  may,  in  its  discretion,  
allow
 
you
 
ﬁve
 
(5)
 
days
 
from
 
the
 
date
 
of
 
notiﬁcation
 
of
 
the
 
breach
 
to
 
remedy
 
it
 
before
 
any
 
such
 
suspension
 
or
 
withdrawal,
 
but
 
is
 
not
 
obliged
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 9.4  Any  suspension  of  the  GoCardless  Account,  any  Service  or  access  to  the  Dashboard  and/or  the  API  will  not  
relieve
 
you
 
of
 
your
 
obligation
 
to
 
pay
 
any
 
amounts
 
due
 
to
 
GoCardless.
 9.5  Where  any  of  the  factors  for  suspension  referred  to  above  cease  to  exist  then  GoCardless  will,  as  soon  as  
reasonably
 
practicable,
 
reinstate
 
your

the
 
GoCardless

Services
 
and
 
the
 
API
 
but
 
may
 
require
 
you
 
to
 
change
 
the
 
Account
 
Details.
 9.6  You  acknowledge  that  where  a  feature  or  part  of  a  feature  of  any  Service  is  provided  by  a  third  party,  it  may  
be
 
necessary
 
for
 
GoCardless
 
to
 
suspend
 
access
 
to
 
that
 
feature
 
of
 
that
 
Service
 
(on
 
a
 
temporary
 
or
 
permanent
 
basis),
 
where
 
the
 
third
 
party
 
terminates
 
or
 
suspends
 
the
 
supply
 
of
 
its
 
own
 
services
 
to
 
GoCardless,
 
the
 
receipt
 
of
 
which
 
by

 14.  CORPORATE  OPT  OUT   What  is  the  ‘Corporate  Opt  Out’?  14.1  The  ‘Corporate  Opt  Out’  is  a  concept  of  Applicable  Law  for  payment  services  which  enables  GoCardless,  as  
a
 
regulated
 
payment
 
service
 
provider,
 
to
 
agree
 
with
 
you
 
that
 
certain
 
protections
 
which
 
may
 
be
 
available
 
to
 
consumers
 
and
 
(in
 
some
 
cases
 
small
 
businesses
 
and
 
charities)
 
do
 
not
 
apply.
  
  How  does  the  Corporate  Opt  Out  apply  to  this  Agreement?   For  UK  and  ROW  (non-Europe)  Merchants  only:  14.2  If  either:  (a)  your  annual  turnover  or  annual  balance  sheet  exceed  two  (2)  million  euros;  or  (b)  you  have  ten  
(10)
 
or
 
more

you
 
operate
 
a
 
charity
 
with
 
an
 
annual
 
income
 
of
 
one
 
(1)
 
million
 
GBP,
 
then
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
a
 
consumer,
 
micro-enterprise
 
or
 
a
 
charity
 
within
 
the
 
meaning
 
of
 
the
 
PSRs.
  
To
 
the
 
extent
 
that
 
such
 
laws
 
apply
 
to

Services
 
and
 
if
 
not
 
otherwise
