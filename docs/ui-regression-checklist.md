# UI Regression Checklist (Bridge)

Canonical source:
- `/.agent/rules/ui-regression-checklist.md`

This file intentionally exists as a bridge to avoid duplicate checklist maintenance in two places.

## Usage

- For code reviews and automated checks, use only `/.agent/rules/ui-regression-checklist.md`.
- If governance changes the checklist, update the canonical file first, then keep this bridge unchanged.
